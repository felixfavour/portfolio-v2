What's living really? What is life in its entirety? Sometimes, it means bearing the burden of never getting to do all the things you really want to do, because you know time is so limited. 

Albeit a vain burden; the Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa & Spanish you'd love to speak seems to be wholly dependent on how much time you have; the C.S Lewis and new fiction titles you would love to read take time too; the guitar and music skills you wish to acquire also require time.

That's what living is—existing, knowing that all your interests might never attain the mastery you truly desire, but you persevere nonetheless—because when you look at the bigger picture, these are not the things that connote happiness.

This week, I spent a lot of time listening to Bez Idakula. Apart from being a great musician, he sings in Hausa too. Side note—Hausa feels a lot less militant when it is being sung, hearing someone speak Hausa in a conversation could be the opposite.

And then the week, ended with a wedding—a friend's brother's wedding. I came in late, but a notable part of the event, despite my late coming was the wedding's after-party. In the words of the MC:

> "If you are 40 and above, please go home. There's traffic on the road and you need to prepare for Sunday School tomorrow."

Truth is, even if I knew at that moment, I identified as 40 and above. I've heard stories of after-parties, and I was sure that it wouldn't be a place I would want to be. But remember, I came late to the wedding, and I hadn't eaten that day, so I was hoping to munch on something before I left.

So I waited long enough, and sure enough, things escalated in a jiffy; think dimmed lights, suffocating atmosphere, blinking neon lights and louder music.

Long story short...I had to leave, without eating.

_It was my birthday this week too, and just in case you're wondering: Yes! I got to spend time with family and it was good._

Sorry for sending this late, my obligations have grown since the year started, but I'm committed to doing this still.

Have a lovely week ahead, even though it's just a few days left.
