### Letâ€™s try something different this week.

### So, what happened this week?

First, a lot of people have been asking me when Iâ€™m getting marriedâ€”which, letâ€™s be honest, is a very awkward question for a young man like me. And, of course, itâ€™s mostly church people asking. 

Somehow, we all in church just accepted that minding our business isnâ€™t our strongest trait. But hey, thatâ€™s the beauty of fellowship! If this is how we banter, sign me up.

Also, Iâ€™ve been thinking about building something to help track my monthly income and expenses. I built something similar a while back, [Mobotithe](https://github.com/felixfavour/Mobotithe?tab=readme-ov-file#mobotithe), but that was five years ago, and itâ€™s no longer robust enough for my current needs.

I already have a clear idea of what I want this new tool to look like, but for the last three weeks, Iâ€™ve been struggling to find time to start, or maybe Iâ€™ve just been unmotivated when I get the free time I'm yearning for. But, letâ€™s see how this week goes.

Finally, a huge win at workâ€”our CEO just won the election as the president of the CFA Society of Nigeria! Thatâ€™s a big deal, considering how prestigious the CFA certification is worldwide, and even more so in Nigeria. But what makes this interesting for me is the direct impact I get to observe.

I consider it a rare privilege to have casual conversations with someone like Razaqâ€”whether itâ€™s when our eyes meet across the office or when we sit down to eat. Watching how he navigates this new role and its possible outcomes in his primary company is something Iâ€™m paying close attention to.

Iâ€™m curious: how quickly can a company grow when its founder actively steps out of their comfort zone and becomes a public figure?

As a shy person, this is something Iâ€™ve struggled with a lot. But maybe seeing someone close to me do it successfully will push me to be more visible and vocal with my ventures. 

I really need to get this business thing right, Iâ€™ve called myself an entrepreneur, well, too many times.

And thatâ€™s it for this week! Soâ€¦did you finish reading before the song ended?

Have a lovely week ahead, and sorry this came a little late! ðŸ˜Š
