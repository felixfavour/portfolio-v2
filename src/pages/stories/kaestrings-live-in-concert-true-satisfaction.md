You know, the last couple of months have been a horror show when it comes to financing my business, [Cloud of Worship](https://cloudofworship.com).

Every month, I’ve had to pay a recurring $15–$20 bill just so users could access cloud storage. But this week, I’m so happy to say that I’ve brought that number down to zero—with no service cuts or interruptions. That’s a big win.

For my technical readers: AWS was choking me. After rounds of optimization and trimming down services I didn’t truly need, I’m now able to serve the same number of users at no cost. One less bill to worry about as a business owner. I know, I know...it's splendid.

Now, shifting away from business for a bit—as a man (yes, a man) who's been able to meet his basic needs and, sometimes, even spend on things he didn’t really need, it's been sobering to realize that *nothing in this world can truly satisfy*.

I don’t like applying logic to God, because my reasoning can’t wrap around His infinite depth. But still, this week I wondered:

> Why wouldn’t someone who longs for real satisfaction look to God?

God is the only being in existence whose essence can never be fully unraveled, and that alone makes Him worth pursuing. In my view, if your whole life is a journey of discovering more about Him, that’s an adventure worth living.

Finally, I went to a concert this week and got home really late. Still, it was so refreshing to enjoy the companionship of those who call on the Lord with a pure heart.

I got to listen to **Kaestrings** worship live—and if you know me, you know I’ve been listening since 2022, back when barely anyone knew or cared that he existed. 

What I love most is his grit—his relentless effort to grow, and how intentional he was about being discovered, not ignored. That, I absolutely *stan*.

That’s it from me this week. I hope to see you next week. Bye for now.
