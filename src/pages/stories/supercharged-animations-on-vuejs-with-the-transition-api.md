I’ll be honest: I’m easily gripped by animations and purposeful motion on the Web, so much so that I wrote a [whole article](https://favourfelix.com/stories/css-and-motion-build-animations-on-the-web/) on it. However, I’m also a big fan of the Vue.js framework, and I’ve been building apps with it for three years.

All of these is why it was a delightful surprise when I realized that I could take advantage of **ONLY** the Transition API in Vue.js while leveraging my decent CSS skills to animate a component’s enter and exit animations in such a fluid manner.

## **How fluid? You might ask.**

<div style="padding:81.88% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/872452747?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;quality_selector=1&amp;progress_bar=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Animations with the Vue.js Transition and TransitionGroup API"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

In this article, we'll dive into a straightforward movie app with built-in filtering features. By the end, you should have a solid understanding of the `<Transition>`  and  `<TransitionGroup>` components in Vue.js and how they seamlessly handle enter and exit animations within Vue.js.
