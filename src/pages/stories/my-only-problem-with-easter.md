When was the last time you ran in the rain—just to feel like a child again?

I know you’ve mastered the art of being an adult, or at least, you’re doing your best. But can you still be a child too? **Read till the end for a rare video of me playing in the rain as a full-grown 20-something-year-old man.**


Aside from the lovely downpour, something else warmed my heart this week—I received a really kind message from someone I looked up to back in 2021. Let’s call him *Ndubuisi*.

At the time, I was preparing to leave the country to study in the UAE. I had no plans of returning; I hoped to get a job there and settle in. So, I did what anyone in that position might do: reach out to people who had already walked that path.

Although my priorities changed and I didn’t end up going, Ndubuisi remained an inspiration. He showed me that even if I chose to stay, it was still possible to build something meaningful.

And now, he reached out to say he had been inspired by the work I’ve been doing, with projects like **Cloud of Worship**. He also mentioned how it had challenged him to take on similar initiatives.  **A win for the gospel? Yessss!**

Now, on a slightly different note: it’s still Easter season, and while there’s plenty to be thankful for, there’s one part that consistently gets under my skin—**the "impressive" copywriting from brands on social media.**

Instead of simply saying “Happy Easter”, they attempt some overly clever wordplay without good enough context of the situation and the season's significance. 

Please—don’t do it. If you don’t fully understand the meaning, just send your greetings and move on. No need to upsell your business in times like this.

Sure, there’s also the whole “easter bunnies and eggs” conversation, but that one is for another time. Maybe next year.

Anyway, I hope you’re enjoying the holiday.  

See you next week, and here’s [the video](https://photos.app.goo.gl/EBZw6q2hrYSrZF8z7) I promised _:)_
