I remember when my biggest worry was the number of strokes I’d get on my buttocks if I didn’t finish my homework. Those were good times. Scary? Yes! But compared to now, I’d choose those early days in a heartbeat.

This week, I barely spoke to any friends on the phone. The few who called got an excuse from me. I also didn’t do much walking too, I had enough to stress about after making a very delusional promise to my colleagues at work about a deadline I had no business setting.

On Friday, though, I went to watch my company’s football match against another company. Being in that moment reminded me of one of the underrated perks of having a job—you get to interact with people consistently. Whether you like it or not, working with the same faces every week nudges you into becoming a more social being. [Last year, this was something I lacked](https://favourfelix.com/stories/i-left-my-9-to-5-job/) heavily.

But let’s talk about the real madness: men (like me) and football. The calmest guys suddenly become aggressive, some even ready to throw fists. And I’m supposed to believe this is all passion for the game? Lol.

Beyond that, I also had to relive my secondary school trauma—not being picked for any team. To be fair, I never really showed interest (especially in all the heated conversations that happened of the pitch), but still, you could have asked first.

Lastly, I’m hoping to make my Saturdays strictly for personal work and my Sundays for rest. I’ll experiment with it over the coming weeks, can’t let [cloudofworship.com](https://cloudofworship.com/) and all the ideas in my head go to waste.

And that's all of the interesting stuff that happened this past week. I’d love to hear how yours went too, feel free to share.

Have a wonderful week ahead!
