I think I love being an entrepreneur more than being an employee. I haven’t worked this hard for a company since 2020—this weekend was a grind with a tight deadline, but guess what? I smiled through it. I guess my teammates on this project made it easy.

Earlier this week, though, I had a short conversation with a really close friend about how bad I’d gotten at reading. Meanwhile, she was proudly sharing that she had already finished two books this year. I wasn’t moved—she had every right to brag. Thankfully, she helped me come up with a system: just five pages a day and journaling afterwards. Spoiler; I’ve been doing terribly at it.

Also this week, I fell asleep at the steering wheel for the first time ever. Thankfully, my spider senses kicked in instantly, and I didn’t hit anyone or a surface. It was early in the morning, and I had been woken up to run an errand (one of the many prices I pay for not paying rent, but I can live with it).

A handful of thoughts intruded on my mind this week, but the ones that stood out were about burdens and meditation.

Some days, life feels overwhelming. There’s so much to do, so much to think about, that you hit a tipping point where nothing matters, and you just want to be reckless. I’m learning that those are the moments I need to cast my burdens on Him—because He really does care for me.

I’ve also realized that meditating on God’s Word is far more effective than just reading it. Sometimes, reading feels like a ritual, but the irony is that if you don’t read, there’s nothing to meditate on. Still, I’ll prioritize meditation more (This deduction may or may not have been influenced by the drastic reduction in how much of my time I can control).

Lately, I’ve been curious about what life looks like for married men, because, in a few years, that could be me. It feels both scary and exciting. So, I thought it’d be interesting to ask ten married people about their experiences—what they’ve enjoyed most, their toughest moments, and what marriage has really been like for them. Pairing that with reading a few books on the subject should help me prepare. It sounds like a fun study, and I already have a few participants in mind.

Anyway, I hope this week turns out great for you—I know it will for me. The hardest part of my current project is behind me (I hope).

Feel free to reply and share how your week went too. See you next week!
