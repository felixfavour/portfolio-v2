We just wrapped up the week of love, but the season isn’t lost on us. Happy Valentine’s to all who celebrate.

This past week, no one showed me just how much they cared like NEPA _(PHCN if you will, she doesn't care much for it)_. The sheer detail and intentionality in taking out power for two days straight drenched me in deep affection—or rather, sweat as I slept every night. Their love language is definitely not one I understand yet, but I’m willing to play the long game.

Thankfully, I managed to turn lemons into lemonade because guess who turned this into a vigil? Me! Of course.

Also this week, I rekindled my love for badminton, a sport I first fell for in secondary school. There’s never been a game; mobile or physical, that I consistently beat my brother at except badminton, and that’s saying a lot because he plays a lot of games. I hope to make this a weekly habit, but more importantly, I hope you stick around long enough to see if I actually do.

Finally, Cloud of Worship had the opportunity to secure a booth at a national conference where Christian business leaders and clergymen from different denominations will be gathering. This would have been an excellent chance to spread the word about Cloud of Worship, but the 3-day conference isn’t on a weekend, and well…I have a job.

I do, however, plan to attend for at least one day—to soak in some knowledge, hope for the best, and strike up meaningful conversations.

That pretty much sums up my week. I’d love to hear how yours went too, feel free to share.

Have a wonderful week ahead!
