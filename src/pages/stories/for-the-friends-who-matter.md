The melodies of "Let her go" by passenger ring in my ear as I write, whether it's the iconic(akon-ic) voice of Michael David Rosenberg that's really intriguing or the story that the lyrics tell that resonate deeply with me. I'm not really sure tbh, but listening to it while I write seems awkwardly comforting.

It's the second part of my weekly journal, and the week has been eventful. Returned to church just last week, and it was just nice being around my people—the church is my biggest form of socializing, probably the only social group after my family that I hold really dearly.

I'm also still doing interviews for a growth genius for Cloud of Worship, even if I'm no longer taking applications—I'm trying to not be hyperfocused on distributing an opening when I'm widening my focus to be on my current employer.

Sometime in the middle of the week, I got on the longest phone call I had ever been, I think that's milestone enough to make it to this piece. The call lasted for almost six hours, and all I'll say is Airtel really made a lot of money. Jokes aside, I intend to sacrifice much more time talking to the people that really matter to me.

To crown the week with a huge win, we got our first active user on Cloud of Worship from the Netherlands, thats the first from outside Western Africa, Southern Africa, and India; yes, we've worked really hard but I'm not sure we deserve this yet.

The steady progress with Cloud of Worship, especially with reach reminds me of one of the most powerful things my mom told me last year: "The Holy Spirit can be your marketer".

In the end, CoW is God's work, and I'll keep doing my little part while I wait to see what He really wants to do with this.

Thank you for reading—I'd really love to know how your own week went.

See you soon.
