You know what? I try so hard to not make this journal a place where I nag about how exhausting work can be sometimes; on some days, I ask myself if the life God wants for me is to be drained by the thought of work I have ahead of me—but I remember that scripture says not to be slothful in business, even as I stay fervent in Spirit.

But how am I even supposed to be fervent in spirit with this work climate; sitting on a screen from morning till evening? With the thought of deadlines. I resume daily Bible study next week sha, it's been a minute and it's telling on me.

Apart from that, I'm an adult—I think. So I'm free to pull the plug on the many things that might feel like a burden to me if I really want to, I might disappoint a few people but it's my life, and really these people are not family.

Talking about things that feel like a burden to me, let's talk about texting and how much of a chore it is. Texting can be fun on some days, but getting a whirlwind of messages from different places can just be so overwhelming. 

Unlike a considerable number of people, I love to clear out messages before I go to bed, as long as I'm not too busy. That's why if I don't clear them all out, it feels like I have a tab in my head that I am yet to attend to.

Finally, just before we call it a week, I learnt something weighty this week, and I'd love to share it with you, and also with my future self who would be reading this. A lot has happened this week, and in the past weeks too, and it's what brought me here:

Being an adult is understanding that many people would have a good reason not to show up for you when you need them the most and you can’t fault them for it. 

I hope this helped you as much as it did me. I'll see you next week!
