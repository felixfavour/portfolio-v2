Before now, making your website responsive was limited to resizing HTML elements with media queries. This was, and still is, a brilliant innovation for web development in general.

But web development has evolved with the advent of JavaScript frameworks—particularly with the use of components as building blocks in developing User Interfaces.

In this article, we will explore responsive design beyond the viewport with Container Queries and analyze an example of a fully responsive site using just container queries.
