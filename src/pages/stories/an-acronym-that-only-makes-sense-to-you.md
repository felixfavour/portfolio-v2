Do you know what it feels like to walk **30,000+ steps in a day**? How about **50,000+ in two days**? Of course, you don'tâ€”but I do. ðŸ˜Œ  And now, my brain is playing tricks on me, making me think I could actually survive a marathon. Maybe I should register for one? Stay tuned to find out.  

Aside from putting my inner *Kipchoge* on display this week, I did some broodingâ€”and a few interesting things too.  

I reinstalled Instagram. For the first time this year. I hated that I had to, but it was necessary. I needed to buy an item from a previous vendor, and there was no other way to reach them. Of course, you can trust me to **completely forget** my actual reason for opening the app and go straight into mindless scrolling of reels.  

I think that's Instagramâ€™s superpowerâ€”to distract you from your real intent. Thankfully, I got what I needed and successfully made my exit. That was my **one and only** Instagram quota for this quarter.  

I also got a new guitar this weekâ€”the first one Iâ€™ve ever bought with my own money. My very first guitar was a gift from my aunt (so kind of her), but this one feels different, like a small milestone.

Of course, the week wasnâ€™t without its challenges. I had to pay a speed limit fine for going just 5km over. On one hand, I feel like a responsible citizen for paying it without being nudged; on the other handâ€”Iâ€™m just a boy.

### A Thought on Public Journals  

I want to be as honest as possible when I write here, but since this is a public journal, I wonder how some of my stories might be perceived by the different personas reading this.  

But againâ€”this is *my* journal. I shouldnâ€™t care.  

Anyway, for very good reasons, Iâ€™ll keep one part of my week to myself, leaving only an acronym that will only make sense to me:  

**WMALSA-HNH-ATD2**  

Until next time. ;)
