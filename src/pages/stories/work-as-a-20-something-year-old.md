I’m coming to terms with the fact that life will be like this for a while. Everyone is struggling to endure the hustle and bustle of Lagos. It’s hard to even complain to someone else because you just know; they’re probably going through the same thing. At best, all you can do is find joy in the shared struggles and laugh about them sheepishly.

That was just a fancy way of saying: _I saw shege this week, mehn_. My struggles matter too! And I recognize that for the life I’m trying to build, this might just be the tip of the iceberg. But we go rough am. 

Soon, I’ll be able to chase my dream of being an entrepreneur, and at least then, I’ll get to suffer on my own terms.

### But what really happened this week?

This week, I got the chance to release something I’m really proud of at work; we rolled out [Gifts by Cowrywise](https://my.cowrywise.com/gifts). But in the thick of it, I had a realization: **I’ve met some truly good people in this life**. 

I’ve always been fascinated by people who are just genuinely kind; the ones who do things for others without expecting anything in return, who show up for you even when you don’t ask. That’s such an admirable trait to me, and I can only hope that I become that kind of person to the people I interact with every day.

Also this week—though much earlier—I had some fleeting thoughts about my parents and the emotions that get stirred up during certain conversations. I’m writing this down now so that when I grow older and have kids, I’ll remember not to take it personally when their opinions don’t align with mine.

Amidst all this stress and these thoughts, I completely slipped in my Bible study this week—very shameful, tbh. And I promise this is the last time that will ever happen. If I ever report this to you again, please scold me however you can.

The week is still young, and there’s plenty left to do! Feel free to share how your week went, and I’ll see you next week. 

Have a wonderful week ahead!
