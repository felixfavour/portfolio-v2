First off, I’m so sorry this is coming late. Last week was a lot—I had to delete WhatsApp just to focus and get things done. As the week wrapped up, I was hardly ever home, so this couldn’t have happened any sooner than today.

Looking back at last week, I found it really hard to work on [cloudofworship.com](https://cloudofworship.com). Every time I got home from work and lay down, I just felt completely drained. On the rare occasions when I had enough energy to turn on my laptop, it was mostly to wrap up tasks I had started at the office.

Despite the busy schedule, I made a conscious effort to reflect on God’s word. As I write this, I feel even more encouraged to keep at it in the coming week. 

I’ve realized that keeping this public journal helps me stay mindful of the steps I’ve taken—because without it, it’s easy to forget. Now, I understand why it’s so important to dwell on God’s word intentionally.

Work took up most of my week, and it looks like the same will happen this week, maybe until the first week of February—there’s so much to wrap up at the office. 

One thing I did notice, though, is that I’m more of a pessimist than I thought. I tend to think of worst-case scenarios rather than best-case ones, and more often than not, my contingent resort is managing failures.

A great way to end—or start—the week is attending house fellowship on Sunday evenings. It’s usually filled with refreshing conversations and meaningful interactions, and I’m really looking forward to that again this week.

I hope your week wasn’t as exhausting as mine. Feel free to reply to this email—I’d love to hear how your week went too!

Have a wonderful week ahead.
