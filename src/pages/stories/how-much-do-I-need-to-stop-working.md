Peer pressure really got to me this week—I gave in and downloaded Snapchat. It turns out that there were some serious consequences that I had to deal with. It might take a while to fully recover, but I’m pressing on, and I run with perseverance the race ahead of me.

On a different note, I [wrote something random](https://favourfelix.com/stories/test-product-market-fit-for-open-source-projects/) this week, really random. I’m glad I didn’t overthink it and just started writing; otherwise, it probably never would have seen the light of day.

A realization hit me hard this week after coming across a quote by Blaise Pascal:

>“We never really live; we only hope to live. We are always preparing to be happy, but we are never truly happy.”

That made me reflect on how much time I spend planning for the future, forgetting that the present, and the people around me are just as important, if not more.

Interestingly, the very next day, I had a deep conversation with some coworkers about our “number”—how much money we’d need to never worry about working or recurring expenses again. It made me wonder: what would you do if money were no longer a concern? I’d continue when you tell me.

Tbh, it's fine if you don't tell me. For me? I’d go to music school and probably bring to life any business idea that sparks excitement while working with people who truly resonate with the why behind it.

Also, I went jogging twice this week—jogging, not walking. That’s a big deal for me, lol. But while jogging, I had this thought: wouldn’t a “perfect” life actually be pretty boring?

I mean, what’s life without the excitement of missing a morning jog, slipping up on fitness goals, or indulging in the occasional “wrong” meal? I like to think this isn’t a pessimistic view, but rather an appreciation for the little struggles that make our achievements feel more meaningful. Maybe the pursuit itself is what keeps us going.

So yeah, I’m in no rush to become an all-round achiever. I’m just here to enjoy the journey.

That’s it for this week. Feel free to reply via email if you’d like.

See you next week!
