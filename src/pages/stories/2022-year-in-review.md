Hello, I should have started this at the beginning of the year. But here I am starting on the 12th day of November. Thankfully, I take a lot of photos, and you know what they say, “pictures tell the whole story”. So give me a minute to take a look at my gallery.

Alright, so here’s what I found. <br /> Like previous years, 2022 was funny and challenging, but there's a lot of firsts.

Hello, again. It’s the 25th day of December, and I’ve been thinking: the beauty of a year-in-review article is captured in its informal tone, so I’d do that instead.

Even though I want to do this in a less formal way than my previous articles, I’d still give it some structure. That said, here’s 2022 in no particular order.

## Work

Like any other person that loves what they do, I work hard, maybe too hard. I am a Software Engineer and a TikTok-er on weekends. Nah, I’m kidding. Just a Software Engineer for now. For context, a Software Engineer is anyone who writes code and attends meetings for money.

![My workspace while I was in the UAE.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/favour-portfolio.appspot.com/o/stories%2F2022-work.webp?alt=media&token=9fcaed0e-2ecf-4de0-945f-64f3674d08ca)

I did a lot of impactful stuff at work this year, I worked with some diverse teams in England, the US and India, all remotely. I enjoyed my time with all of these guys, asked questions about their culture and just tried to get as much exposure as I could.

What was the impactful stuff I worked on? I did a lot, but the one I am most proud of is [Robin](https://robinapp.co?ref=favourfelix.com). Robin helps you build apps like Whatsapp or Telegram in about 5 minutes. Robin is growing and achieving numbers, and I am so proud that I am one of the reasons it exists in the first place. 

Some other cool stuff I worked on at work was [Kinly](http://bekinly.com), [Brassica](http://brassicafin.com) and [Tendar](http://tendar.co).

## School

**TL;DR** - I got a BSc. Information Technology from Middlesex University, London (Nope, this one is not remote. I was blessed to study in the Dubai campus, life and direct)

![Me with some of my classmates in school](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/favour-portfolio.appspot.com/o/stories%2F2022-school.webp?alt=media&token=bad31e67-1629-4fa1-9abc-8a191977ab5f)

Travelled to the UAE to complete my university education and took the risk of doing it while working. It was a struggle, so damn painful, really, really painful. God really helped me go through that ‘cos it felt like I was going under.

It was particularly painful because I didn’t just want to go through school, I wanted to give it a lot of my attention and excel academically, and I paid the price. Getting good sleep felt like a luxury, and I spent nights, mornings and afternoons in the study room, working and studying.

Thankfully, all those sleepless nights paid off, and I graduated with a First class. My dad can rest now, me too, lol.

## Entrepreneurship

I’ve been writing code for almost five years now, and I wanted to do more. So, my silly response was to try entrepreneurship and boy, it’s been interesting than anything I have experienced in my profession, and I would explain why.

![Me at a Tech Mixer in Downtown Dubai.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/favour-portfolio.appspot.com/o/stories%2F2022-entrepreneurship.webp?alt=media&token=d325cdda-d414-4566-80d9-754b1f4a0ef9)

I started my entrepreneurship journey with [Robin](https://robinapp.co), sort of, I had to do some operations tasks and move a few things around business-wise. I attended a lot of meetings that I’d say were focused on business decisions rather than my usual product development meetings.

After Robin, I gained the confidence to start [Revaise](https://revaise.com). The process that led to Revaise’s birth is a simple one, actually. I saw a problem with no existing solution, and I invited a friend to help me build one. This is me paraphrasing—the full story is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/favourfelix_remotework-peerreview-productivity-activity-6998936201453821952-gARa?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

The sail on this entrepreneur-ship has been an interesting journey for me because I get to do a lot of things, not just write code. I get to make design and product decisions, and even do a little sales and marketing when the need arises.

This is not to say being an entrepreneur has been all fun and easy, not at all. I just love that I can’t predict what’s ahead.

## Creative Writing

In 2022, I took writing seriously again. Sometime from 2018 to 2020, I used to write a lot of tech articles (find them [here](https://theniclex.wordpress.com/author/raphfelix/)), but I paused when I got a full-time job.

![Some random image from my gallery on Creative Writing.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/favour-portfolio.appspot.com/o/stories%2F2022-writing.webp?alt=media&token=16360508-eefd-4b01-b4c9-fb1ed3f7c0e0)

This year, I resumed and went harder. This time, I’m taking a rather multi-faceted approach with a little emphasis on technical writing. I don’t earn money from writing just yet; I’m not keen on it. Like every other skill in life, I believe when you give out value you’d be rewarded. I’m learning mastery for now.

I know mastering creative writing is difficult. I have a few people around me, and on the internet to help me achieve that. For now, I’d keep on writing quality content and get as much feedback as I can where necessary.

A major feat I achieved in this category this year was being accepted as a contributor at FreeCodeCamp and becoming a [2022 Top Contributor](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-2022-top-contributors/). For me, that’s enough fuel for the new year.

## Personal Development

To start with, I did a couple of mentorships and guidance this year — *funny ‘cos na all of us dey grow together*, but if you trust me, I should trust me too, right?

I also spoke publicly in two places this year, the first with over 7,000 people in audience and the other with about 500, interestingly, both events occurred in a month. It was an honour for me to speak to people in such a large volume, and I hope to do more of it in the new year.

Some other big achievements for me this year were [reading books](https://favourfelix.com/books/) and playing the piano—I read three books this year, and they all were different genres; history, theology and business. That’s progress in my books (I promise, no pun intended).

I also learnt to play the piano. Playing the piano is so soothing. 

Okay, I’d be honest, the truth is I might never be really good at playing the piano, but if I can make melodies with my voice and some basic chords on the piano, I think I’d be fine.

Finally, I did not take the gym seriously this year, and I probably would do the same next year. However, I’m hoping I can be more cautious about what I eat and my physical well-being in general. 

## Relationships

![Video call with siblings.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/favour-portfolio.appspot.com/o/stories%2F2022-family.webp?alt=media&token=63e8df70-a9b1-430f-973c-c2ecec72b59f)

I met a lot of beautiful souls last year, particularly in school, work and church, maybe only those. My social sphere in 2022 was quite small because I had a lot to do. I’m pretty confident that 2023 would be significantly different (if the cost of transportation drops in the new year).

The little friends I had really made all the difference. 

Finally, for a relationship with a significant other, as you would have guessed, I am without a significant other. With all the plans in front of me, it’s somewhat daunting to try dating. *I no dey rule am out sha*. My hands and eyes are open.

## Faith

Save the best for the last? Yes, please.

![A Quote from CS Lewis.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/favour-portfolio.appspot.com/o/stories%2F2022-faith.webp?alt=media&token=5635227a-dcdd-4e80-88c9-102923f0f3da)

I try to make sure that everything I do stems from my faith and beliefs, and if you are one that talks to me frequently, the realization should not be far-fetched.

I set a lot of goals for the new year. Obviously, you can’t be too close to God, so I wanted to be closer—spend more time in His word, pray more and just love God more. 

Unfortunately, as committed as I might have sounded in the penultimate paragraphs, I did not hit my targets as much as I should have. I’m blaming it on the overtime hours I, intentionally, spent working for no just cause.

I’m really hopeful for 2023. I will have to make a lot of sacrifices, a lot more than I made this year, and I am ready for them.

## Conclusion

Well, this was easier than I thought. An article takes me a minimum of three weeks for compilation and research, but I compiled this in a night. I hope this teaches you to always go the informal route and speak from the heart.

If you sincerely read this far, you probably like me so much, or I am a really good writer; whichever it is, feel free to fuel my ego via email. I’d need it for possible imposter syndrome attacks in the new year.

Thank you so much!
