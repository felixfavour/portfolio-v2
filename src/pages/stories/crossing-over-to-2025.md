This week was a whirlwind with two flights. I returned from the last one about three hours ago, and I’m completely exhausted—but here I am, cos I really have to do this.

I travelled to Enugu on Monday and returned today, Saturday, all by myself. I had to catch an early flight back for a work meeting that couldn’t be done online. Honestly, I enjoy lone trips to the airport; they give me space to be as expressive as I want. More on that later.

This week also marked the crossover to 2025—and for the first time, I spent it at home. There wasn’t a known church nearby, so we planned to wake up and praise our way into the new year. Unfortunately, we all ended up sleeping through it. Sad, but it is what it is.

On a brighter note, I started a new Bible plan with some friends. Bible plans used to be my go-to for staying consistent with Bible study. These days, though, I’ve developed an internal nudge—a kind of “muscle memory”—that pushes me to read my Bible daily, even without a structured plan.

Another major milestone this week: I became an employer. Not by choice, really, but out of necessity. For [Cloud of Worship](https://cloudofworship.com) to grow, I need someone to take on some of the work I can no longer devote as much time to. It’s a strange feeling knowing so many great candidates applied, but we can only pick one.

Work at Cowrywise has been intense. It’s a culture where everyone does way more than the bare minimum, and while I’m not one to settle for mediocrity, it’s definitely a shift from environments where that attitude might slide. Essentially, I foresee it being really hard to stand out here, but the Lord strengthens me.

Back to the airport story—I met a lady and her brother there. Well, I met her first. She’s a pretty lady by my standards (whatever that means). We didn’t talk much until after we landed, and I ended up chatting more with her brother. I wanted to carpool with them because getting a taxi alone felt like Mission Impossible (thanks to the prices). Plus, I thought it would be nice to have company for the ride.

Turns out we weren’t headed in the same direction. Still, I did something a bit silly—something she benefitted from, probably because of pretty privilege. To be fair, her brother was really chill too, which made it easier to help. Do I regret my actions? Not at all. Would I do it again? Hopefully. Did I gain anything? Let’s just say my reward is in heaven.

Lastly, I didn’t manage to finish The Problem of Pain before the year ended, and Dunsin Oyekan dropped the music video for Judah. If you look closely, you’ll spot me in the cast!
