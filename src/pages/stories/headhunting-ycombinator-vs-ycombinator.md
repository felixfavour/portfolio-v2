Remember how last week ended, when I said I’d dedicate Saturdays to personal work and reserve Sundays for rest? Yeah…that didn’t happen. It’s funny how life plays out. But that’s okay—things won’t always go as planned; the key is to expect it and realign quickly.

This past Wednesday, I had the opportunity to speak with a one-day intern for International Women’s Day. My team lead entrusted me with that honour, and I truly appreciated it. As for my conversation with her, I loved it. She was incredibly soulful, and I shared [more about it on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/favourfelix_in-a-male-dominated-field-like-software-engineering-activity-7304230223670071296-jOwb).

Honestly, most of these musings feel like work updates. Maybe I should just call this “My Work Journal”? Because, once again, this week was another release cycle, which meant pressure was high, and this time, I didn’t even meet the deadline.

To be fair, it shouldn’t have been this intense, but I was also juggling a church summit that ran for most of the week. No complaints, though. I have a goal to be the absolute best I can be at work, and I’m hoping all of this effort pays off.

Stepping away from work for a bit, I had a speaking engagement with the teenagers at my church over the weekend. And let me just say—I still haven’t cracked public speaking the way I’d love to. I hope I get more opportunities to practice and improve.

Finallyyyy, something exciting happened this week—something that hasn’t happened in a while. A CEO from a YC-backed company reached out to headhunt me on LinkedIn. And honestly? That felt really good, and I feel so grateful.

For the first time in a long while, I feel like I’m in control of my career trajectory, and the uncertainties that weighed on me after months of job hunting feel much lighter.

On a lighter note, I currently work at a YC-backed company, so I can’t say I appreciate them trying to poach from their fellow alumni ;)

Anyway, that was my week. I hope you enjoyed reading, and I’d love to hear how your week went too.

Have a lovely week ahead!
