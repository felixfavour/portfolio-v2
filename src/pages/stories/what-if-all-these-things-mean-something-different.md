What if the "other things" that will be added mean a healing of your desires to be all that HE wants for you? And not really the carnal things you had in mind that made you selfishly "seek first" the kingdom of God.

What if Matthew 6:33 doesn't really mean what you have always thought it to? How would that affect your service and devotion? These were some of the most provoking thoughts in some of my evening walks this week.

But about thoughts, this time a little bit more mundane: I spent some time thinking about how people donâ€™t always recognize how hard it is for developers to switch contexts so quickly. Itâ€™s been normalized to the best of my knowledge, but that doesnâ€™t make it easy. Itâ€™s impressive that we manage to do it so seamlessly.

To be fair, this might not just be a developer thing, maybe other professions experience this too. But _e no concern me_, you can speak for yourself in your own weekly journal. ðŸ˜‰

### A Heart Full of Gratitude  

Lately, Iâ€™ve been feeling deeply grateful for how life has turned outâ€”and how it keeps unfolding. I donâ€™t have the best life, but I recognize that many things I consider trivial are far from trivial outside my sphere. Health, a job, time, familyâ€”these are things I never want to take for granted.  

And thatâ€™s it for this week! Sorry itâ€™s coming lateâ€”I promise to do better next time.  

Feel free to share how your week went. Iâ€™d love to hear about it!
