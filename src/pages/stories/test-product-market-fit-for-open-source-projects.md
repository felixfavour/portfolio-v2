How do you test product-market fit for open-source projects? I mean no one is outrightly asking you to pay for money to access this tool. It's mostly free.

Unlike traditional products where revenue can be a clear indicator, open-source projects are usually free to access, making product-market fit harder to measure.

Instead of direct sales, signs of PMF with open-source communities might come from increasing adoption, growing community engagement, and contributions from sponsors.

For [cloudofworship.com](https://cloudofworship.com), I wouldn’t say we’ve fully achieved product-market fit yet. However, I recently received a GitHub badge for creating a repository with over 15 stars.

While this might not seem like a huge milestone, it feels significant to me because I’m not deeply involved in open-source communities or active at community events—something I’m working to change.

The fact that people have discovered [Cloud of Worship](https://cloudofworship.com)—either by searching for a solution like ours or from a friend's recommendations suggests we’re addressing a real need. That looks like an early sign of product-market fit if you ask me.

If you’re interested in the project, we’re currently looking for contributors! You can also support us by leaving a star here: [git.new/cloudofworship](https://git.new/cloudofworship).
