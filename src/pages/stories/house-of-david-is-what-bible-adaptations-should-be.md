At the beginning of April, I decided to take my healthy life goal at the beginning of the year a little bit more seriously. That meant just being more mindful of the food I was eating and doing some exercise. And somehow I've been very dedicated to this cause.

Since the day I made this decision, I've hit 12k steps every single day, maybe apart from 2 days, I've also not indulged in junk food, I haven't eaten bread and I don't think I can say how big of a sacrifice that was. And sure enough, I'm achieving my goal - a healthier lifestyle and weight loss, but the sharp weight drop I saw at the beginning doesn't seem like is recurring and that's discouraging.

On the bright side, this week, I broke my record of a 5k run (38:43). And I know this might not look like a lot for the probable pro runners reading this, still it's a milestone for me. My next goal will be to complete a 10k run. But I'll keep bumping it up until I get there.

This week too, I started watching House of David; last week actually; but continuing an episode this week made me know how special of a show it is. Really, I think House of David should be the standard for movies geared to be Bible adaptations.

The sweet spot for me was how they were able to uniquely blend peak creativity and urge the audience to pick up a Bible to read how the story they are watching might have ensued. And even if you know how the story will end, you still just want to see how they visualized it. It's been a great watch so far.

And finally, this week, I remembered how bad of a reader I am. Will you believe me if I told you I haven't completed any books this year? Not even an audiobook.

Anyways, that's it for this week. See you next week.
