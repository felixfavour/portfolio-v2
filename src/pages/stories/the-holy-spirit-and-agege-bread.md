I haven't had such an unrestful weekend in a while, and it's Monday again.  
And to make it worse, I'm typing this by 3 AM, with mosquitoes butchering my feet, not by choice, but because the power is out, and I have to make good use of this time.  Oh, my lovely Nigeria.

It's my 6th month working at my new place of work, and it really still feels like I am thinking slowly.  I struggle to partake in some conversations and while I try to contribute, deep down, I have no idea what they might be doing in a particular project.  

I'll still give myself some grace and trust the process anyway.

Still in the line of self-awareness, something I've recently come to understand about myself is my obsession with my space.  And maybe that's why I find it difficult to engage in conversations with new people, it's also why I get uneasy when things are moved around from where I might have kept them.  

This is not something I'm proud of anyway, and I'm actively seeking to change it.  You can share tips if you have any.

While at it, how do people detach so easily from a conversation they have with other people?  Maybe because I rarely start conversations and relationships, that's why they hold more weight to me?  At least in this regard, you can't blame me for being too careful.

As I wrap up this week's journal, I want to give a special shout-out to the Holy Spirit.  Yes! The same one Jesus left for us before He ascended.

I've had my heart hurt this week and been so annoyed over things that many people might call disregard.  But to have a comforter, that can make that heart as soft as fresh "Agege Bread", feels very magical.

Finally, recent happenings have provoked this: you don't need to be a pastor to be fervent.  Not everyone has to be a pastor.  

Heck! Many people don't want to, but it doesn't mean you lose fervency.  
The only difference I see is not having a flock that you have to shepherd.

That's all for this week.  It's 3:48 AM, let me see if I can get some sleep in before I set out for work.  Bye :)
