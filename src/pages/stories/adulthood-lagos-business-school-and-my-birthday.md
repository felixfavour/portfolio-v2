After a long evening, I’d honestly rather continue my [Corpers' Lodge series](https://youtu.be/JkSvMgR_cXg?si=9Ag2VD42Sr3hDzso&t=1670) than write. You’d think that after doing this every week for the last four months, it would be easy by now—but no, it’s not. 

Still, it's slowly becoming a habit, one I no longer need to remind myself to keep up with, or be burdened by. This past week, I went back to Lagos Business School, but this time, not as a guest. I was a host.  

We were invited to co-host a few guests as LBS launched a case study about my company's unique marketing and customer acquisition strategies.

It was a meaningful moment. I ran into an old friend (well, not that old), met some high-profile people, and even overcame my shyness to speak to one of them. You can read the full story on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/favourfelix_one-of-the-fascinating-things-about-working-activity-7323673819624214528-4G6d) if you're curious.

While I was returning from LBS, an unfortunate event occurred. Things went south with my colleague’s car while I was driving. I won’t bore you with the details, but I really haven’t liked how things have unfolded since. Still, knowing it could have gone much worse is some form of comfort.

After all that came a different kind of challenge: adulthood, in all its glory. Here’s something you already know but probably don’t want to hear again: Adulthood is a series of endless bills and obligations. What makes it worse for me? I don’t even pay rent, and yet, it hurts.

But here’s a tiny hack that has made adulthood a little easier for me—something you may already know and do:  Make your bed before heading out.

I read recently that no matter how badly your day goes, coming back to a clean room and a made bed can instantly help you feel better. It works, try it!

Finally, it's my birthday week. In case you are wondering, I'm not sure what I'll do yet. For me, birthdays have never really been fancy, a wonderful birthday for me could be just spending some time with family and friends in the cool of the evening—I hope I'm lucky enough to get a wonderful one this year.

Like every other day anyway, I'll be grateful to God for where I am, and where He is taking me to.

That's all for this week. I'm going to watch a movie while I sleep off now. Thank you Jesus for today!
