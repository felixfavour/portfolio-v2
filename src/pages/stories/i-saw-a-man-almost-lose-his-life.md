“Please God, not man.”—I wrote that line in my journal this week, and I honestly can’t remember what triggered it. Maybe it was a few scenes from the *House of David* series.  

It’s strange—how easy it is to say you’re being true to yourself, yet still find yourself serving others in ways that are more about appeasement than sincerity. Especially in a place of worship, the only one we owe that kind of reverence to is God. Not man.

But before I let my thoughts drift into a full-blown rant, let me walk you through what actually happened this week. There was a **near-death experience**—right in front of me.  

At church, a man collapsed. He looked lifeless. Blood was drooling from his mouth, and he lay completely still on the floor. I panicked. I ran to find a medical professional in the church. Silly me didn’t think to pause and pray first.  

Thankfully, two pastors rushed to the scene ahead of the medical team and began praying over him. And miraculously, before the medics arrived, he regained consciousness. He still needed treatment, and we got him the help he needed, but that was a scary event.  

Turns out, the man wasn’t even a member of the church. But interestingly, he said he knew my mom. Apparently, we wouldn’t have been able to get him admitted to the hospital without identifying him first, to avoid legal _wahala_. That moment showed me a kind part of my mom I might have ignored—especially to people society often ignores—the _area boys_, the junkies, the ex-convicts.  

I remember going to her shop in Oshodi a while back and seeing _agberos_ rush to hug her and carry her bag.  
It was wild. That’s a whole side of her I’ve never truly experienced as her son, lol.  

Sure, she’s always been a loving mother—but to see that tenderness extended to people many write off? That’s different. Maybe it’s her weekly evangelism that’s given her that open-hearted, free-spirited nature.  
Whatever it is—I admire it deeply.

Also, this week, I finally finished watching *House of David.*  And let me just say—David kissed Michal.  

Now, David wasn't exactly famous for his chastity in the scriptures, but I’m not sure he would have been out French-kissing his King's daughter, a whole king of Israel. But really, it’s the producer’s world. Creative license and all that. He even includes a disclaimer at the start of every episode, so I can’t say I’m too surprised.

That’s pretty much it for this week.  
I’m looking forward to another holiday before the week ends here in Lagos.

But for now,  
**Goodbye till next week.**
