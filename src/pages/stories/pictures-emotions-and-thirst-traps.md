Something remarkable about pictures is how they evoke emotions—joy, grief, peace, or even anger. You take one look, and suddenly, the emotions rush in, completely outside your control.

This week, I took a walk beneath the Apapa-Oworonshoki Expressway flyover and realized that Lagos isn’t as hot as it was a few months ago. The stroll felt serene—the breeze from dashing vehicles sunk in my hair follicles, brushing against my skin, and in that moment, I drifted into memories from three years ago. That’s when I penned down this intro.

But that was just one highlight of my week. I also hit the gym. My company covers a gym membership, so it’s only right I make good use of it. But wow—my gym is not for me. And I don’t mean the workouts. In plain words, my gym is an _ungodly_ zone.

That didn’t stop me from pushing through, though. I got my workout in, only to lose full functionality of my arms for about three days. Every movement hurt, and I briefly regretted going. But I’ll be back—just with a smarter plan, to take it easy and use the gym during strategic hours.

Finally, during another walk, I found myself reflecting on how transient life is. Sorry to go existential, but it really is. Not many people live to 120, yet even after ~120 years on Earth, life continues somewhere it never really ends. And again, I asked myself: How much am I preparing for the place where life truly begins? What is 120 ÷ infinity?

Think on these things, and have a wonderful week ahead. (Feel free to reply to this email and share your story too.)
