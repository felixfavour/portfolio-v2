The hardest thing for me to do right now is get my mind off a 2016 Honda Accord. Here’s why: I’ve loved cars since I was a kid, and that love quickly evolved into a desire to own one; from the moment I collected my first paycheck, even though I couldn’t afford it.

My dad always thought I’d be the kind of person to buy a car as soon as I started making money, mainly because I was obsessed with car brands growing up. I wonder how much pressure I must have unknowingly put on him whenever we drove around in his late ’90s Hyundai Lantra during the late 2000s. Lol.

Anyway, it's 2025, and my burning desire to own a car is back, but I know that the car I truly want, I can't afford. And now, as someone who doesn’t usually crave fancy things, this might be the first time I actually understand what it feels like to be broke.

On another note, something else has been on my mind this week: I’ve realized that women tend to give until there’s nothing left. And that doesn’t necessarily make them more generous, it just means that when they choose to be generous to someone, they often go all in. I’m not sure if the same intensity applies when they choose not to be generous.

Where did this thought come from? I’ve seen it in my mom, my older sister, and this week, I noticed it in someone outside my family.

You might disagree, and that’s fine. This is just my current observation. I know life still has many experiences ahead for me (God willing), and my thoughts might evolve with time and deeper relationships.

That’s all for this week. See you next week!
