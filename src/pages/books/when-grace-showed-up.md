I got this book as a gift from Sunday School, and it took me months, if not a few years, to eventually open it up.

I am glad I eventually opened it and learnt a couple of things. Amidst all I might have learnt from this book, I'll never forget how powerful and therapeutic an act of kindness can be.

I've always known to be nice to people, but the miracles and experiences shared in this book because of the kindness of two people was resounding.

The lessons I learnt from this book have not left me until now, and I hope they stay rooted.
