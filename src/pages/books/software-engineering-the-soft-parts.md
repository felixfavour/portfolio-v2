Think of a resource that empowers you to become a great employee, an efficient leader and a high-performing engineer—that is precisely what this book seeks to achieve.

From arguably the most significant issue in the corporate world, communication, to a lot more critical subjects like technical complexity, seniority in the workplace, time management, demystifying work/life balance and even topics like mentorship—all are covered in his book.

Think of this review as an introduction to my article: [“The 10x Employee: A Guide to Building Efficient Software and Achieving Career Success”](https://favourfelix.com/stories/the-10x-engineer-guide-to-building-efficient-software-and-achieving-career-success). I wrote this after compiling some of my learnings from reading this book. I hope it encourages you to read the book and challenge yourself in your career strides.

Thank you, Addy Osmani! Always appreciative of you sharing knowledge from your experiences.
