I am a very logical person until I have to be a Christian, but Clive Staples Lewis helps me understand that I can be both in his book.

There is a scientific way to think about Christianity, and even though it's not finite, that's fine. I'd instead find comfort in my ignorance than make inexplicable speculations.

From examining the gift of free will, to dissecting the infamous attitude that has destroyed human relationshipsâ€”pride, then exploring the unique concept of God and Time, and sharing thoughts on controversial topics like sexual starvation. This book is packed with thought-provoking notes, and they were all fun to read.

The best part? It's my first book from CS Lewis, and I hope to read more of his in the future. Who knows? Maybe even some fiction.
